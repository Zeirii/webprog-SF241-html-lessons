    <h3>My Technological experience</h3>
    <p>My current experience in IT starts with Kali Linux, which we used in our Infosec subject and during the TrendMicro UCTF as part of team Cynext. We placed around the middle of 250 teams and I am proud to have taken part in it. We also used Ubuntu in our OPESYST class, and I have experience with CMD and SQL, as well as programming languages like Python, Java, HTML, and CSS. AI tools I use to learn include Perplexity, Gemini, and Copilot, and my main coding environments are Visual Studio Code and GitHub.</p>
